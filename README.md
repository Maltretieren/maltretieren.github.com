# Introduction

As soon as I discovered Jekyll on GitHub I'm keen to push the technology of this blog forward.
Starting with Jekyll Bootstrap I enhanced it with many different features...

## Features
- Free to Fork - MIT License
- GitHub Pages compatible (uses only GitHub whitelistet plugins)
- HTTPS always (redirect to HTTPS if the user visits via HTTP)
- Edit feature (append ?edit=true to the url and see, edit, provide password and save)
- Permanent Login via GitHub oAuth2 (login once, edit everytime)
- Interactive tables build out of blog posts - beautiful, searchable, sortable
- Comments via keen.io
- Ratings via keen.io
- Nice image captions
