#Markdown
Markdown is the language which drives most of the content on this page. Instead of writing HTML code you have a higher level language to define how the content looks like... A markdown parser takes the markdown code and translates it to HTML code.

# Parsers available on GitHub

## Configuration
You can configure which markdown parser should be used to generate the content of this site. Refer to the `_config.yml` file in the root directory and look for the "markdown" key:

markdown: kramdown

On GitHub there are 3 different options available:
- kramdown
- redcarpet
- rdiscount

## Kramdown
The documentation can be found on [the Kramdown homepage](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). 

### Quirks
I have some markdown generated by the jsdoc-to-markdown and injected into the ApiDoc. It generates headings as `#heading, but Kramdown only accepts `# heading` (with a space) - while RDiscount is fine with both.

## Redcarpet
The documentation can be found on [the Redcarpet GitHub repository](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet). 

## RDiscount
The documentation can be found on [RDiscount GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidfstr/rdiscount). 

### Quirks
It doesn't support adding a target attribute to a link. This is necessary because html5 mode is enabled on this page. In html5 mode every link needs to contain a `target='_self'` attribute on a link to follow it...
