# Markdown

# Parsers available on GitHub
## Configuration
You can configure which markdown parser should be used to generate the content of this site. Refer to the `_config.yml` file in the root directory and look for the "markdown" key:

markdown: kramdown

On GitHub there are 3 different options available:
- kramdown
- redcarpet
- rdiscount

## Kramdown
The documentation can be found on [enter link description here](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/). 

### Quirks
I have some markdown generated by the jsdoc-to-markdown for the ApiDoc. It generates headings as `#heading', but Kramdown only accepts `# heading' (with a space) - while RDiscount is fine with both.

## Redcarpet

## RDiscount
