# Introduction
This blogging software is simple and lacks some nice features - e.g. to upload and include pictures via the GUI. For me this is not essential because I update the blog most times on my notebook where I have an graphics program, an IDE and Git software installed. Maybe some people don't have.

It would be nice to have a page where people can vote on some features...
