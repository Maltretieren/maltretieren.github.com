# ApiDoc

The output of the ApiDoc documentates the JavaScript code of the AngularJS Controllers and Services. This post shows you the workflow used to create the documentation automatically from the comments in the JavaScript source files using [JSdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/){:target="_self"} and [smartercomments](http://smartcomments.github.io/){:target="_self"}. You can see the results on [the ApiDoc page](https://maltretieren.github.io/apidoc/2014/11/01/ApiDoc/){:target="_self"}

## Flow
In the JavaScript source files you need to annotate your functions with comments. You can see examples at the commenting section. Before running JSdoc, smartcomments takes care of completing the comment sections. After smartcomment completed, ApiDoc is generated by running the grunt task "jsdoc2md" which outputs the documentation in markdown language. The documentation markdown is injected into a template file which will be copied over to the `_posts` directory and commited back to the repository. GitHub will now render the documentation file in my page... 

# JSdoc
JSdoc is used to parse the JavaScript source files for comments. This could be done manually before committing by running the grunt task `jsdoc2md`. By the name of the task you can see that the plugin grunt-jsdoc-to-markdown is used to get the documentation in markdown.

# Smartcomments
I use smartcomments to prevent cluttering my code comments with `@param` annotations, but also to be sure that the documentation of atttributes passed into functions are always up to date. This is an optional task run by Travis during assembly and not pushed back into my repository. The way it works is go through the Javascript codes and where it doesn't find a comment it adds it. It runs before running the JSdoc tast.

So, during Travis build I run the smartcomments generation command defined in .travis.yml`:
{% highlight ruby %}
before_script:
  # automatically generate comments
  - smartcomments -g --config ./tests/config/smartcomments.json
{% endhighlight %}

First you need to have a `./tests/config/smartcomments.json`configuration file
{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
{
    "target_dir": ["app/js/"],
    "match_files": ["^((?!~).)*.(js)$"],
    "backup" : false,
    "private" : true,
    "favor_generated" : true,
    "tags": {
        "function":{
            "name":{},
            "desc":{"value":"Description"},
            "params":{}
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Prevent smartcomments from generating doc for functions you don't want to be visible in the documentation. Annotate with `/** @private  */` comment.

{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
/** @private  */
var privateFunction = function() {
...
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Commenting
Preparation of a Controllers namespace
{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
/**
 * @namespace Controllers
 * @description  The controller must be responsible for binding model data to views using $scope, and control information flow. It does not contain logic to fetch the data or manipulating it.
 */
{% endhighlight %}

Annotating single controllers
{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
/**
 * @namespace Controllers.CommentsCtrl
 * @memborOf Controllers
 * @description `Bundles` *functions* to receive and save comments
 */
 myApp.controller("ExampleCtrl",function ($scope) {
 ...
 }
 
{% endhighlight %}
