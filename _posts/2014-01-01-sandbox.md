This page gives you an idea how you can design your posts. You can use the source code to copy it.   

<!-- more -->

## Front Page
To view a new post on the test frontpage check the "Frontpage" checkbox under "Advanded settings" when you create/edit a post.

## Syntax Highlighting

For more pygment css styles see [pygments-css](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css) or [Solarized Light](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). Replace .codehilite with .highlight for these to work with Jekyll
{% highlight javascript linenos=table %}
var helloWorld = "Hello Jekyll";
alert(helloWorld);
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Include HTML Widgets
{% include widgets/tagCloud.html %}
{% include widgets/timeLine.html %}

## HTML inside markdown
You can use regular HTML in Markdown text. Markdown will ignore them and pass them through untouched. Block-level elements (div, table, pre, p) need to have leading and trailing blank lines and shouldn't be indented.

Markdown formatting works inside non block-level elements (span, cite, etc.) but is turned off inside block-level elements. So you can't use Markdown formatting inside a div, pre, p or table tag.


## Include GISTS
{% gist 9092977 %}

### The Jekyll Application Base Format

Jekyll expects your website directory to be laid out like so:

{% highlight text %}
.
|-- _config.yml
|-- _includes
|-- _layouts
|   |-- default.html
|   |-- post.html
|-- _posts
|   |-- 20011-10-25-open-source-is-good.markdown
|   |-- 20011-04-26-hello-world.markdown
|-- _site
|-- index.html
|-- assets
    |-- css
        |-- style.css
    |-- javascripts
{% endhighlight %}

- **\_config.yml**  
  Stores configuration data.

- **\_includes**  
  This folder is for partial views.

- **\_layouts**   
  This folder is for the main templates your content will be inserted into.
  You can have different layouts for different pages or page sections.

- **\_posts**  
  This folder contains your dynamic content/posts.
  the naming format is required to be `@YEAR-MONTH-DATE-title.MARKUP@`.

- **\_site**  
  This is where the generated site will be placed once Jekyll is done transforming it. 

- **assets**  
  This folder is not part of the standard jekyll structure.
  The assets folder represents _any generic_ folder you happen to create in your root directory.
  Directories and files not properly formatted for jekyll will be left untouched for you to serve normally.
