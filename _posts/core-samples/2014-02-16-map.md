## Test to include a GeoJSON from Github
I queried the [OSM Overpass Turbo API](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) with the wizard for amenity=drinking_water and exported it
as GeoJSON and saved it to the assets/geojson folder of my jekyll site. This is very nice and simple!

## Howto include
Use the script tag to include the map:
{% highlight javascript %}
<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/Maltretieren/maltretieren.github.com/master/assets/geojson/drinking_water.geojson"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

### Are you thirsty?
Go to these places to find free drinking water in Munich (Dated 2014-02-17, Thanks to OpenStreetMap Contributors)
