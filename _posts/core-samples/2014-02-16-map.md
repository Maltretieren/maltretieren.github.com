## Include a GeoJSON hosted on GitHub
The path to follow is to query the [OSM Overpass Turbo API](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) with the wizard e.g.
 for amenity=drinking_water ([more details in German](http://blog.openstreetmap.de/blog/2014/01/der-turbo-fuer-die-overpass-api/)
 and exported it as GeoJSON. Then the file is saved it to the assets/geojson folder of my Jekyll site and pushed to GitHub. This is very nice and simple!

## Howto use in the Jekyll Post
Use the script tag in your Jekyll post to include the map:
{% highlight javascript %}
<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/Maltretieren/maltretieren.github.com/master/assets/geojson/drinking_water.geojson"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
