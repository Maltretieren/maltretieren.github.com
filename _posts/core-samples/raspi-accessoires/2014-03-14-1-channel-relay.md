The use case in my project for the relay is connected to following requirement: I have several devices connected to
my Raspi that needs external power supply - a usb hub that needs 5 volts external power, and a thermal printer,
that needs 9 volts. The devices are powered by an external battery pack. If I cut power from the Raspi (with ATX Raspi)
also want to automatically cut the power of the externally powered devices. I solved this issue by using two of these relays.
